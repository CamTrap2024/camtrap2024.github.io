                    <b>Cliodhna Quigley</b> is a cognitive scientist with a focus on data analysis and computational solutions for the study of animal behaviour. Since joining the Fusani lab in Vienna in 2016, she has been involved in developing new approaches for the group to study courtship in birds using videos recorded in laboratory settings and during fieldwork. As well as tracking movements and quantifying behavioural patterns of courting males and choosing females, she also implemented a laboratory system allowing synchronized playback of high-speed video and audio to bird audiences. Her current research interests include the feasability of applying AI models trained on human movement data to data from animals.

She began her academic journey studying nutritional sciences at the University of Bonn. Following this, she embarked on a short-term assignment in a mycotoxin research laboratory at the University of Arizona. This position quickly ignited her passion for the field and evolved into a rich personal and professional journey over six years, concluding with a husband, two kids, and a doctorate in Plant Pathology & Microbiology in 2010. Following her doctoral studies, Dr. Probst moved on to the Washington State University, USA. For six years, she held the position of Research Professor, investigating applied, innovative methods of disease control for sweet cherries and hops growing in the US Pacific Northwest. In 2018, Claudia and her family returned to Europe, choosing Austria as her new home. She took up a leadership role in the recently established bachelor’s degree program in Agricultural Technology and Management at the University of Applied Sciences in Upper Austria. Besides her teaching duties, she established the research group D-FARM (Digitalization in Forestry, Agriculture, Research, and Management). This interdisciplinary group brings together expertise in image and data processing, computer science, automation technology, forestry, biotechnology, molecular biology, and plant protection. D-Farm is dedicated to addressing the multi-faceted challenges confronting modern agriculture and forestry, using a comprehensive, scientific approach to digital solution development.                    <br /><br />

                    <b>Danielle McKenney</b> is a Data Engineer at Swarovski Optik, where she combines her interest in birds and wildlife with her expertise in machine learning. Her background is in mathematics and computer science, with a focus on data science. At Swarovski Optik, she manages the data infrastructure to support machine learning projects. This includes experimenting with and evaluating different models for integration into optical devices like the AXVisio, the world’s first smart binoculars. This talk will take you on a journey of embedding AI models on the world’s first smart binoculars. We look at the assumptions at the beginning of our project as well as the complexity of embedded software and the dependencies on other hardware components. We will discover the key learnings of our first prototype version and examine our current approach to meet user expectations. Besides the technical challenges when running AI models on an embedded hardware, you will get insights why we found that user experience plays an even more important role in AI applications than in others.

                    The company <b>SmartMultiCopters</b> has its origins in the construction and repair of drones. Interest in the finer points of construction grew with each individual drone and after a short time the first inquiries came in for the manufacture of drones with thermal imaging cameras for searching for fawns. Like that, the company is nowadays working mostly in the field of wildlife management and agriculture and forestry using customized drones, which are produced using 3D printers, but are also manufactured by hand in their drone factory. The drones fly fully automatically by default, you just select the area to be inspected. A glance at the monitor is all it takes to identify the warm area - injured wild animals or young game.

                    <caption>Preliminary Workshop Schedule (all times are in CEST). We are currently in the process of finalizing our program. Our plan is to maintain a format similar to previous editions, with a combination of expert talks and paper presentations. We aim to include around 3-4 expert talks and demos, and the remainder of the 1 ½ days will be dedicated to paper presentations.
                        Each paper's presentation will likely last about 10-15 minutes, allowing for an in-depth look into the presented research. The final schedule will depend on the number of submissions we receive.
